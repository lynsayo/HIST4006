## Week 4: Keeping Track w/ Github - October 1st, 2018
### Issues
+ Ownership of data 
+ Allows reproducibility of data --> can allow studies to be broader 
+ Broader audience 
+ More perspectives --> is this good? bad? 
+ What is data for history? 
+ How to make intelligable notes --> common terminology, common understanding, common syntax, common ethics 
+ What lengths should we go to to protect shared information? Should it be like wikipedia? 
+ Wikipedia often lacks resources, has a lack of ability to evaluate reliability and is a "bad actor"
